ABOUT ROBOTIS
-------------

`ROBOTIS`_ was derived from a simple response to the question, "What is a Robot?".

Thus, **ROBOTIS** = "**ROBOT IS...**"

There are many answers to this question, but we strive to develop and apply products that would impact our daily lives and make robots more personal rather than an intelligent appliance. Imaginations can become reality through personal robots.
