Simulation
==========

.. NOTE:: This instruction was tested on ``Ubuntu 16.04.1`` and ``ROS Kinetic Kame`` version.

TurtleBot3 fake node implementation
-----------------------------------

``TurtleBot3 fake node`` is a very simple simulation node that can be run without a real robot. You can move a robot through a teleop node on a virtual TurtleBot3 on RViz.

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
  roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

Stage (2D)
----------

(TODO)

Gazebo (3D)
-----------

Before launch gazebo simulation with TurtleBot3, ``TurtleBot3 model files`` are moved to ``gazebo model folder``.

.. code-block:: bash

  cp -r  ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_gazebo/worlds/turtlebot3 ~/.gazebo/models/

Set Turtlebot3 model. (burger or waffle)

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
  
``TurtleBot3 empty world`` is a basic gazebo enviroment except any objects.
  
.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch
  
The TurtleBot3 drives by teleoperation with a keyboard.
  
  .. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

``TurtleBot3 world`` is a simple map has the shape of a TurtleBot3 symbol.
 Â 
.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

The TurtleBot3 can freely moves in a turtlebot3 world.

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch

Rviz shows published topics when simulation is launched.

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch
