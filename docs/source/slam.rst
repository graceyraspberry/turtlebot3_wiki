SLAM
====

.. NOTE:: This instruction was tested on ``Ubuntu 16.04.1`` and ``ROS Kinetic Kame`` version.

.. WARNING:: Make sure that the step :ref:`[Bringup]<chapter_bringup>` was carried on previously to follow the instructions.

.. TIP:: Here recommends to use the joystick pad instead of the keyboard, because of its operability.

The Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, or SLAM, is a technique to draw a map by estimating the current position in virtual space while searching the areas in the arbitrary space.

The SLAM technique is a typical function of the TurtleBot3, and is a class of the Turtlebot brand. A video here shows how much accurately the TurtleBot3 can draw the map, even if it is a small, cheap robot platform.

Create a map through the teleoperation
------------------------------

[Remote PC] Open a terminal, then run the SLAM launch file.

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
  roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch

[Remote PC] Visualize the model by the Rviz.

.. code-block:: bash

  rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtlebot3_slam`/rviz/turtlebot3_slam.rviz

[Remote PC] Teleoperation with Keyboard

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

Save the map to file
--------------------

[Remote PC] Open a terminal, then run map saver node.

.. code-block:: bash

  rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map

The files named as **map.pgm** and **map.yaml** will be built in the ``~/`` directory ($HOME directory, /home/<username>).
