.. NOTE:: This instruction was tested on ``Ubuntu 16.04.1`` and ``ROS Kinetic Kame`` version.

We are going to start the TurtleBot3 Auto project for Autonomous Driving with TurtleBot3.

The video shows that the TurtleBot3 itself gets its eye by attaching a $40 Raspberry Pi Camera, and uses the open source from MIT DuckieTown engineering to tracking the lane.
